# ✅ FINAL STATUS REPORT

**Date**: July 22, 2026  
**Status**: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - SERVICES FULLY OPERATIONAL

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE - UnknownHostException**
**Problem**: Event Gateway couldn't reach Account Service  
- Cause: AccountServiceClient was configured to use Docker hostname `account-service:8081`
- Local services run on `localhost:8081`
- Result: DNS resolution failure

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `AccountServiceClient.java` line 20
- Changed from: `http://account-service:8081`
- Changed to: `http://localhost:8081`
- ✅ Service-to-service communication now works

---

### **Issue 2: 500 Internal Server Error on POST /events**
**Problem**: Event creation was failing  
- Cause: Incorrect payload format in test requests

**Solution Provided**:
- Field must be `type`, not `eventType`
- Type must be `CREDIT` or `DEBIT`, not `DEPOSIT` or `WITHDRAWAL`
- Must include all required fields: `eventId`, `accountId`, `type`, `amount`, `currency`, `eventTimestamp`

**✅ Now working** with correct payload format

---

### **Issue 3: Logging Configuration Errors**
**Problem**: Logback.xml had unsupported Logstash encoder configuration  
- Cause: Version incompatibility with LogStash encoder

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced LogStash encoder with simple JSON pattern format
- Both services now use compatible logging configuration
- ✅ JSON structured logging working

---

### **Issue 4: Sleuth Configuration Error**
**Problem**: Propagation type `b3single` not recognized  
- Cause: Version incompatibility with Spring Cloud Sleuth

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed from: `spring.sleuth.propagation.type=w3c,b3single`
- Changed to: `spring.sleuth.propagation.type=w3c,b3`
- ✅ Distributed tracing now functional

## 🟢 Current Status

### **Services Running**
- ✅ **Account Service**: http://localhost:8081 - UP
- ✅ **Event Gateway**: http://localhost:8080 - UP

### **Endpoints Verified Working**
- ✅ `GET /health` (both services)
- ✅ `POST /events` (create events)
- ✅ `GET /events` (list events)
- ✅ `GET /events?account=ACC001` (filter by account)
- ✅ `GET /accounts/{id}/balance` (check balance)

- ✅ Balance calculation (CREDIT adds, DEBIT subtracts)
- ✅ Distributed tracing with trace ID propagation
- ✅ JSON structured logging with service names
- ✅ Centralized error handling
- ✅ Health checks with database status
- ✅ Metrics collection and exposure

## 📊 Test Results

### **Test 1: Create Event**
```
Request: POST /events
Payload: {"eventId":"evt-1412098824","accountId":"ACC001","type":"CREDIT","amount":1000,"currency":"USD","eventTimestamp":"2026-07-22T11:00:21.068Z"}
Response: 201 Created ✅
Result: Event created successfully
```

### **Test 2: Check Balance**
```
Request: GET /accounts/ACC001/balance
Response: {"accountId":"ACC001","balance":1000.00,"currency":"USD"} ✅
Result: Balance correctly calculated
```

### **Test 3: List Events**
```
Request: GET /events?account=ACC001
Response: [{"eventId":"evt-1412098824",...}] ✅
Result: Event appears in list
```

### **Test 4: Get Account Details**
```
Request: GET /accounts/ACC001
Response: {"accountId":"ACC001","balance":1000.00,"currency":"USD","recentTransactions":[...]} ✅
Result: Account details with transactions retrieved
```

## 🔧 Configuration Changes Made

### **AccountServiceClient.java**
```java
// BEFORE
private static final String ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL = "http://account-service:8081";

// AFTER
private static final String ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL = "http://localhost:8081";
```

### **application.properties (both services)**
```properties
# BEFORE
spring.sleuth.propagation.type=w3c,b3single

# AFTER
spring.sleuth.propagation.type=w3c,b3
```

### **logback.xml (both services)**
```xml
<!-- BEFORE: Used LogStash encoder with incompatible fieldNames -->
<!-- AFTER: Simple JSON pattern format -->
<pattern>{"timestamp":"%d{ISO8601}","service":"...","level":"%level","logger":"%logger{36}","traceId":"%X{X-B3-TraceId}","message":"%msg"}%n</pattern>
```

## 📋 API Documentation

### **Correct Payload Format**
```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-unique-id",
  "accountId": "ACC001",
  "type": "CREDIT",              // Must be CREDIT or DEBIT
  "amount": 1000,                 // Must be > 0
  "currency": "USD",
  "eventTimestamp": "2026-07-22T11:00:00.000Z"  // ISO 8601 format
}
```

### **Common Field Mistakes (FIXED)**
- ❌ `eventType` → ✅ `type`
- ❌ `DEPOSIT` → ✅ `CREDIT`
- ❌ `WITHDRAWAL` → ✅ `DEBIT`
- ❌ `b3single` → ✅ `b3`
- ❌ `account-service:8081` → ✅ `localhost:8081`
